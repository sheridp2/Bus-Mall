#User Stories

##Marketing team
* As a marketer, I want the layout of the page to be easy for a user to navigate and understand.
* I want the number of clicks as well as the percentage of clicks on the product to be stored and not visable to the user.
* I want no duplicate images to appear in the 3 shown or repeat image from the last round.
* I need the data to be easily readable after the user makes 25 selections.

##The Developer
* As the developer, I need a function that randomly chooses 3 pictures that did not appear in the last round.
* I need a way for those new images to all be differnt with no duplicates in the same round.
* I need aa click counter that ends the app when it reached 25 clicks.
* Also a click counter for each individual picture that records total clicks recieved.
* I will need the final totals for each picture only be visible to the marketing team and not the user.

##Focus Group
* As the focus group, I need for the apps directions and layout to be easy to understand.
* I will need the app to only count my click if it is on one of the pictures.
* I will need a prompt when the running of the app is completed.
* I will need to not be able to see the results so that they might reamin untainted.
